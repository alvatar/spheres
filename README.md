# [SchemeSpheres](http://www.schemespheres.org)

_A set of tools and libraries for real-life Scheme. Multiplatform and mobile._

[Visit the project web page](http://www.schemespheres.org)


## Installation

1. Copy the .gambcini file to your HOME directory. This is Gambit's initialization file.
2. (optional) Copy the _spheres/_ directory into your Gambit's installation library directory (i.e. /usr/local/Gambit/lib)
3. Update all .gambcini paths to where your SchemeSpheres files are located (either Gambit's library directory, if you copied the files there, or any other path where you choose to leave SchemeSpheres' files).

Currently, SchemeSpheres requires the [Gambit Scheme compiler](http://schemespheres.org). Some libraries in SchemeSpheres are already compatible with r7rs implementations such as Chibi.
